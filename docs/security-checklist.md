# Security Checklist

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures and checks that should be performed regularly to maintain the security of the CastChat application.

## Pre-Deployment Security Checks

### 1. Code Security
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or API keys in source code
- [ ] All environment variables properly configured
- [ ] Sensitive data not logged
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (Supabase handles this)
- [ ] XSS protection in place

### 2. Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] Strong password requirements enforced
- [ ] Session management properly configured
- [ ] JWT tokens securely handled
- [ ] Role-based access control implemented
- [ ] OAuth flow properly secured

### 3. Data Protection
- [ ] Database Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- [ ] API endpoints properly protected
- [ ] File upload restrictions in place
- [ ] Data encryption at rest (Supabase default)
- [ ] HTTPS enforced everywhere

### 4. Infrastructure Security
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] CORS properly configured
- [ ] CDN security settings enabled
- [ ] Database access restricted
- [ ] No unnecessary services exposed

## Security Headers Verification

Verify these headers are set in production:

```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()
```

## Database Security

### Row Level Security Policies

Verify these RLS policies are active:

#### Users Table
- Users can view all profiles
- Users can only update their own profile
- Users cannot delete other users

#### Posts Table
- Anyone can view published posts
- Users can only create posts as themselves
- Users can only edit/delete their own posts

#### Applications Table
- Users can only view applications for their own posts or applications they created
- Users can only create applications as themselves
- Users can only edit their own applications

### Database Access
- [ ] Direct database access restricted to authorized personnel
- [ ] Service role key not exposed to client
- [ ] Anonymous access properly limited
- [ ] Audit logging enabled

## API Security

### Endpoint Protection
```typescript
// Example: Verify user can only access their own data
const { data: user } = await supabase.auth.getUser()
if (!user || user.id !== requestedUserId) {
  throw new Error('Unauthorized')
}
```

### Rate Limiting
- [ ] API rate limiting configured
- [ ] DoS protection enabled
- [ ] Resource usage monitoring

## File Upload Security

### Restrictions
- [ ] File type validation
- [ ] File size limits
- [ ] Malware scanning (if implemented)
- [ ] Secure storage configuration

```typescript
// Example: File upload validation
const allowedTypes = ['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/webp']
const maxSize = 5 * 1024 * 1024 // 5MB

if (!allowedTypes.includes(file.type)) {
  throw new Error('Invalid file type')
}

if (file.size > maxSize) {
  throw new Error('File too large')
}
```

## Client-Side Security

### Content Security Policy
```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" 
      content="default-src 'self'; 
               script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://www.googletagmanager.com;
               style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
               img-src 'self' data: https:;
               connect-src 'self' https://*.supabase.co;
               frame-src 'none';">
```

### Input Sanitization

echo "Checking for secrets..."
git log --all --full-history -- "*.env*" | grep -i "secret\|key\|password" && echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  Secrets found in git history!"

# Check npm audit
echo "Running npm audit..."
npm audit --audit-level=moderate

# Check for outdated packages
echo "Checking for outdated packages..."
npm outdated

# Check security headers (requires deployment)
if [ "$1" = "deployed" ]; then
  echo "Checking security headers..."
  curl -I https://castchat.jp | grep -E "(X-|Content-Security|Strict-Transport)"
fi

echo "‚úÖ Security checks complete"
```
